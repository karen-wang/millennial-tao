“Clark calls day-to-day life for North Atlantic right whales 'acoustic hell.'…The main source of all that noise of the propellers and engines of commercial
shipping vessels, the ones that bring us all that stuff. Besieged by sublethal impacts, the health of North Atlantic right whales has visibly worsened. They are
thinner than they were three decades ago, more heavily infested with whale lice, and more marked by lesions and scars; the females give birth to fewer calves. “

J.B. MacKinnon, _The Day the World Stops Shopping_

I read this today after spending the morning shopping for an iPhone case on Amazon - part of the endless mountain of aforementioned stuff.

Who wouldn’t give up buying dumb stuff like a new iPhone case if it could save the whales? Yet you’re probably wondering, and rightly so, whether or not buying a new iPhone case will have any impact on the suffering of whales unless _everybody_ stops buying iPhone cases altogether. And since that likely isn’t going to happen all of a sudden…I might as well buy it, right?

I used to subscribe wholeheartedly to the idea that individual choices can make an impact on global issues like climate change. However, as I’ve grown older I’ve become more and more inclined to resign myself to the belief that our individual choices are meaningless in the face of the impending climate catastrophe. After all, it’s not just iPhone cases that are problematic - it’s the cars that we drive that use up fuel and electricity, the food we eat that gets shipped from halfway across the world, the furniture we use that is cheaply assembled and easily discarded. When I realized how damaging my everyday participance in a consumer society is to the environment, it felt absurd to call myself an “environmentalist.” I once read somewhere that “the single best thing you can do for the environment is to not have a kid.” If that’s true, then the next best thing is killing yourself.

However, since asking everybody to kill themselves will likely have a strictly lower success rate than asking everybody to stop buying new iPhone cases, we need a better solution to save the whales.

A few weeks ago, I was giving a friend of a friend a ride to San Jose. Since she was getting her PhD in environmental sociology, I asked her if she found it silly when people talk about saving the environment through consumer choices like using a metal straw or driving a Tesla. To my surprise, she said not necessarily.

“While becoming vegan or cancelling your Amazon Prime subscription might ultimately be meaningless, collective political action is definitely meaningful in the long run,” she said. “If your lifestyle choices allow you to identify as an environmentally-conscious individual and raise awareness in your community, that could become the catalyst for things like organizing calling campaigns to your local representatives and asking them about their climate change initiatives.” In other words, if buying a new iPhone case is going to make me question my identity as an environmentalist, and reduce the likelihood that I take meaningful political action, then yes - it will eventually be bad for the environment, and for the whales.

Moreover, there actually haven’t been extensive studies on the long-term environmental impact of consumer decisions made en-masse. It’s too complicated of a phenomenon to measure rigorously. The closest we’ve come are global disasters that sent shockwaves through consumer habits, such as the coronavirus lockdown; or 20 years ago, the aftermath of 9/11.

In the days after 9/11, all commercial shipping activity on the North Atlantic seas virtually stopped. At that time, a group of marine biologists took advantage of this opportunity to gather some whale poop. “When the data came back on how much stress hormone was in the whales’ feces that they had collected during that eerily quiet time, they found anxiety levels lower by far than under ‘normal’ conditions. In the absence of the usual shipping traffic, the fishing boats, the pleasure craft, the power yachts, all the hubbub of modern maritime life, the whales were apparently enjoying a sea of calm.”

So who knows? Maybe by not buying that iPhone case, I can help out a whale or two.
